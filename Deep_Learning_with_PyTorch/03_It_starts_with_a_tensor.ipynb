    "Since floating-point numbers are the way a network deals with information, we need a way to encode real-world data of the kind we want to process into something digestible by a network and then decode the output back to something we can understand and use for our purpose.\n",

    "A deep neural network typically learns the transformation from one form of data to another in stages, which means the partially transformed data between each stage can be thought of as a sequence of intermediate representations. For image recognition, early representations can be things such as edge detection or certain textures like fur. Deeper representations can capture more complex structures like ears, noses, or eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, such intermediate representations are collections of floating-point numbers that characterize the input and capture the data’s structure in a way that is instrumental for describing how inputs are mapped to the outputs of the neural network. Such characterization is specific to the task at hand and is learned from relevant examples. These collections of floating-point numbers and their manipulation are at the heart of modern AI—we will see several examples of this throughout the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to keep in mind that these intermediate representations (like those shown in the second step of `figure 3.1`) are the results of combining the input with the weights of the previous layer of neurons. Each intermediate representation is unique to the inputs that preceeded it.\n",

    "`PyTorch` introduces a fundamental data structure: the tensor. In the context of deep learning, tensors refer to the generalization of vectors and matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions, as we can see in `figure 3.2`. Another name for the same concept is `multidimensional array`. The dimensionality of a tensor coincides with the number of indexes used to refer to scalar values within the tensor.\n",

    "We’ll start this chapter by introducing `PyTorch` tensors, covering the basics in order to set things in motion for our work in the rest of the book. First and foremost, we’ll learn how to manipulate tensors using the `PyTorch` tensor library. This includes things like how the data is stored in memory, how certain operations can be performed on arbitrarily large tensors in constant time, and the aforementioned `NumPy` interoperability and GPU acceleration. Understanding the capabilities and API of tensors is important if they’re to become go-to tools in our programming toolbox.

Each element is a 32-bit float in this case, as we can see on the right side of `figure 3.3`. This means storing a 1D tensor of $1,000,000$ float numbers will require exactly $4,000,000$ contiguous bytes, plus a small overhead for the metadata (such as dimensions and numeric type).\n",

Instead of having coordinates as numbers in a Python list, as we did earlier, we can use a one-dimensional tensor by storing $Xs$ in the even indices and $Ys$ in the odd indices, like this:"

    "## 3.5 Tensor element types\n",
    "So far, we have covered the basics of how tensors work, but we have not yet touched on what kinds of numeric types we can store in a Tensor. As we hinted at in `section 3.2`, using the standard Python numeric types can be suboptimal for several reasons:\n",
    "+ Numbers in Python are objects. Whereas a floating-point number might require only, for instance, 32 bits to be represented on a computer, Python will convert it into a full-fledged Python object with reference counting, and so on. This operation, called `boxing`, is not a problem if we need to store a small number of numbers, but allocating millions gets very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Lists in Python are meant for sequential collections of objects. There are no operations defined for, say, efficiently taking the dot product of two vectors, or summing vectors together. Also, Python lists have no way of optimizing the layout of their contents in memory, as they are indexable collections of pointers to Python objects (of any kind, not just numbers). Finally, Python lists are one-dimensional, and although we can create lists of lists, this is again very inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ The Python interpreter is slow compared to optimized, compiled code. Performing mathematical operations on large collections of numerical data can be much faster using optimized code written in a compiled, low-level language like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, data science libraries rely on `NumPy` or introduce dedicated data structures like `PyTorch` tensors, which provide efficient low-level implementations of numerical data structures and related operations on them, wrapped in a convenient high-level API. To enable this, the objects within a tensor must all be numbers of the same type, and `PyTorch` must keep track of this numeric type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.1 Specifying the numeric type with dtype\n",
    "The `dtype` argument to tensor constructors (that is, functions like `tensor`, `zeros`, and `ones`) specifies the numerical data (`d`) type that will be contained in the tensor. The data type specifies the possible values the tensor can hold and the number of bytes per value. The `dtype` argument is deliberately similar to the standard `NumPy` argument of the same name. Here’s a list of the possible values for the `dtype` argument:\n",
    "+ `torch.float32` or `torch.float`: 32-bit floating-point \n",
    "+ `torch.float64` or `torch.double`: 64-bit, double-precision floating-point \n",
    "+ `torch.float16` or `torch.half`: 16-bit, half-precision floating-point \n",
    "+ `torch.int8`: signed 8-bit integers \n",
    "+ `torch.uint8`: unsigned 8-bit integers\n",
    "+ `torch.int16` or `torch.short`: signed 16-bit integers\n",
    "+ `torch.int32` or `torch.int`: signed 32-bit integers\n",
    "+ `torch.int64` or `torch.long`: signed 64-bit integers \n",
    "+ `torch.bool`: Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "The default data type for tensors is 32-bit floating-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.2 A dtype for every occasion\n",
    "As we will see in future chapters, computations happening in neural networks are typically executed with 32-bit floating-point precision. Higher precision, like 64-bit, will not buy improvements in the accuracy of a model and will require more memory and computing time. The 16-bit floating-point, half-precision data type is not present natively in standard CPU, but it is offered on modern GPU. It is possible to switch to half-precision to decrease the footprint of a neural network model if needed, with a minor impact on accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be used as indexes in other tensors. In this case, `PyTorch` expects indexing tensors to have a 64-bit integer data type. Creating a tensor with integers as arguments, such as using `torch.tensor([2, 2])`, will create a 64-bit integer tensor by default. As such, we’ll spend most of our time dealing with `float32` and `int64`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, predicates on tensors, such as $\\textit{points} \\gt 1.0$, produce bool tensors indicating whether each individual element satisfies the condition. These are the numeric types in a nutshell.\n",

(Before the regular build process, you need to run `tools/amd_build/build_amd.py` to translate the GPU code.) Support for Google’s [TPU](https://github.com/pytorch/xla) is a work in progress , with the current proof of concept available to the public in Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

    "We’ve mentioned `NumPy` here and there. While we do not consider `NumPy` a prerequisite for reading this book, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with `NumPy` due to its ubiquity in the Python data science ecosystem. `PyTorch` tensors can be converted to `NumPy` arrays and vice versa very efficiently. By doing so, we can take advantage of the huge swath of functionality in the wider Python ecosystem that has built up around the `NumPy` array type. This zero-copy interoperability with `NumPy` arrays is due to the storage system working with the [Python buffer protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html).\n",

    "For the purposes of this book, and for the vast majority of applications in general, tensors are multidimensional arrays, just as we’ve seen in this chapter. If we risk a peek under the hood of `PyTorch`, there is a twist: how the data is stored under the hood is separate from the tensor API we discussed in `section 3.6`. Any implementation that meets the contract of that API can be considered a tensor!\n",

    "`PyTorch` will cause the right computation functions to be called regardless of whether our tensor is on the CPU or the GPU. This is accomplished through a dispatching mechanism, and that mechanism can cater to other tensor types by hooking up the user-facing API to the right backend functions. Sure enough, there are other kinds of tensors: some are specific to certain classes of hardware devices (like Google TPUs), and others have data-representation strategies that differ from the dense array style we’ve seen so far. For example, sparse tensors store only nonzero entries, along with index information. The `PyTorch` dispatcher on the left in `figure 3.8` is designed to be extensible; the subsequent switching done to accommodate the various numeric types of `figure 3.8` shown on the right is a fixed aspect of the implementation coded into each backend.\n",

    "## 3.12 Serializing tensors\n",
    "Creating a tensor on the fly is all well and good, but if the data inside is valuable, we will want to save it to a file and load it back at some point. After all, we don’t want to have to retrain a model from scratch every time we start running our program! `PyTorch` uses pickle under the hood to serialize the tensor object, plus dedicated serialization code for the storage. Here’s how we can save our points tensor to an `ourpoints.t` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "torch.save(points, '../data/p1ch3/ourpoints.t')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, we can pass a file descriptor in lieu of the filename:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "with open('../data/p1ch3/ourpoints.t','wb') as f:\n",
    "    torch.save(points, f)\n",
    "```\n",

    "Loading our points back is similarly a one-liner:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "points = torch.load('../data/p1ch3/ourpoints.t')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('../data/p1ch3/ourpoints.t','rb') as f:\n",
    "    points = torch.load(f)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can quickly save tensors this way if we only want to load them with `PyTorch`, the file format itself is not interoperable: we can’t read the tensor with software other than `PyTorch`. Depending on the use case, this may or may not be a limitation, but we should learn how to save tensors interoperably for those times when it is. We’ll look next at how to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.12.1 Serializing to HDF5 with h5py\n",
    "Every use case is unique, but we suspect needing to save tensors interoperably will be more common when introducing `PyTorch` into existing systems that already rely on different libraries. New projects probably won’t need to do this as often.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those cases when you need to, however, you can use the [HDF5](www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5) format and library. HDF5 is a portable, widely supported format for representing serialized multidimensional arrays, organized in a nested key-value dictionary. Python supports HDF5 through the [h5py](www.h5py.org) library, which accepts and returns data in the form of `NumPy` arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can save our points tensor by converting it to a `NumPy` array (at no cost, as we noted earlier) and passing it to the `create_dataset` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import h5py\n",

    "dset = f.create_dataset('coords', data=points.numpy())\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `coords` is a key into the HDF5 file. We can have other keys—even nested ones. One of the interesting things in HDF5 is that we can index the dataset while on disk and access only the elements we’re interested in. Let’s suppose we want to load just the last two points in our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = h5py.File('../data/p1ch3/ourpoints.hdf5', 'r')\n",
    "dset = f['coords']\n",
    "last_points = dset[-2:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is not loaded when the file is opened or the dataset is required. Rather, the data stays on disk until we request the second and last rows in the dataset. At that point, h5py accesses those two columns and returns a `NumPy` array-like object encapsulating that region in that dataset that behaves like a `NumPy` array and has the same API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Owing to this fact, we can pass the returned object to the `torch.from_numpy` function to obtain a tensor directly. Note that in this case, the data is copied over to the tensor’s storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "last_points = torch.from_numpy(dset[-2:])\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we’re finished loading data, we close the file. Closing the HDFS file invalidates the datasets, and trying to access `dset` afterward will give an exception. As long as we stick to the order shown here, we are fine and can now work with the `last_points` tensor."
