    "#  07. Modern Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "Now that we understand the basics of wiring together convolutional neural networks, we will take you through a tour of modern deep learning. In this chapter, each section will correspond to a significant neural network architecture that was at some point (or currently) the base model upon which an enormous amount of research and projects were built. Each of these networks was at briefly a dominant architecture and many were at one point winners or runners-up in the famous `ImageNet` competition, which has served as a barometer of progress on supervised learning in computer vision since 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models include \n",
    "+ `AlexNet`: the first large-scale network deployed to beat conventional computer vision methods on a large-scale vision challenge; \n",
    "+ `VGG`: makes use of a number of repeating blocks of elements\n",
    "+ `NiN`: network in network, which convolves whole neural networks patch-wise over inputs\n",
    "+ `GoogLeNet`: makes use of networks with parallel concatenations\n",
    "+ `ResNet`: residual networks, which are the most popular go-to architecture today\n",
    "+ `DenseNet`: densely connected networks, which are expensive to compute but have set some recent benchmarks\n",

    "## 7.7 Densely Connected Networks (DenseNet)\n",
    "`ResNet` significantly changed the view of how to parametrize the functions in deep networks. `DenseNet` is to some extent the logical extension of this. To understand how to arrive at it, let us take a small detour to theory. Recall the Taylor expansion for functions. For scalars it can be written as\n",
    "$$f(x) = f(0) + f'(x) x + \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) x^2 + \\frac{1}{6} f'''(x) x^3 + o(x^3).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.7.1 Function Decomposition\n",
    "The key point is that it decomposes the function into increasingly higher order terms. In a similar vein, `ResNet` decomposes functions into\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x} + g(\\mathbf{x}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, `ResNet` decomposes $f$ into a simple linear term and a more complex nonlinear one. What if we want to go beyond two terms? A solution was proposed by (`Huang et al., 2017`) in the form of `DenseNet`, an architecture that reported record performance on the ImageNet dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/07_11.png\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in `Fig. 7.7.1`, the key difference between `ResNet` and `DenseNet` is that in the latter case outputs are concatenated rather than added. As a result we perform a mapping from $\\mathbf{x}$ to its values after applying an increasingly complex sequence of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x} \\to \\left[\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x}), f_2(\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x})), f_3(\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x}), f_2(\\mathbf{x}, f_1(\\mathbf{x})), \\ldots\\right].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, all these functions are combined in an MLP to reduce the number of features again. In terms of implementation this is quite simple---rather than adding terms, we concatenate them. The name `DenseNet` arises from the fact that the dependency graph between variables becomes quite dense. The last layer of such a chain is densely connected to all previous layers. The main components that compose a `DenseNet` are dense blocks and transition layers. The former defines how the inputs and outputs are concatenated, while the latter controls the number of channels so that it is not too large. The dense connections are shown in `Fig. 7.7.2`.\n",

    "2. One of the advantages mentioned in the DenseNet paper is that its model parameters are smaller than those of ResNet. Why is this the case?\n",
    "3 .One problem for which DenseNet has been criticized is its high memory consumption.\n",
    "    + Is this really the case? Try to change the input shape to $224\\times 224$ to see the actual (GPU) memory consumption.\n",
    "    + Can you think of an alternative means of reducing the memory consumption? How would you need to change the framework?\n",
    "4. Implement the various DenseNet versions presented in Table 1 of :cite:Huang.Liu.Van-Der-Maaten.ea.2017.\n",
    "5. Why do we not need to concatenate terms if we are just interested in $\\mathbf{x}$ and $f(\\mathbf{x})$ for ResNet? Why do we need this for more than two layers in DenseNet?\n",
