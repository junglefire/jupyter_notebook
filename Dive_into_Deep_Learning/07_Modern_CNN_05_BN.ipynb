    "#  07. Modern Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "Now that we understand the basics of wiring together convolutional neural networks, we will take you through a tour of modern deep learning. In this chapter, each section will correspond to a significant neural network architecture that was at some point (or currently) the base model upon which an enormous amount of research and projects were built. Each of these networks was at briefly a dominant architecture and many were at one point winners or runners-up in the famous `ImageNet` competition, which has served as a barometer of progress on supervised learning in computer vision since 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models include \n",
    "+ `AlexNet`: the first large-scale network deployed to beat conventional computer vision methods on a large-scale vision challenge; \n",
    "+ `VGG`: makes use of a number of repeating blocks of elements\n",
    "+ `NiN`: network in network, which convolves whole neural networks patch-wise over inputs\n",
    "+ `GoogLeNet`: makes use of networks with parallel concatenations\n",
    "+ `ResNet`: residual networks, which are the most popular go-to architecture today\n",
    "+ `DenseNet`: densely connected networks, which are expensive to compute but have set some recent benchmarks\n",

    "## 7.5 Batch Normalization\n",
    "Training deep neural nets is difficult. And getting them to converge in a reasonable amount of time can be tricky.\n",
    "In this section, we describe `batch normalization` (`BN`) (`Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015`), a popular and effective technique that consistently accelerates the convergence of deep nets. Together with residual blocks—covered in `Section 7.6`—BN has made it possible for practitioners to routinely train networks with over 100 layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.5.1 Training Deep Networks\n",
    "To motivate batch normalization, let us review a few practical challenges that arise when training ML models and neural nets in particular.\n",
    "1. Choices regarding data preprocessing often make an enormous difference in the final results. Recall our application of multilayer perceptrons to predicting house prices (`Section 4.10`). Our first step when working with real data was to standardize our input features to each have a mean of zero and variance of one. Intuitively, this standardization plays nicely with our optimizers because it puts the parameters are a-priori at a similar scale.\n",
    "For a typical MLP or CNN, as we train, the activations in intermediate layers may take values with widely varying magnitudes—both along the layers from the input to the output, across nodes in the same layer, and over time due to our updates to the model's parameters. The inventors of batch normalization postulated informally that this drift in the distribution of activations could hamper the convergence of the network. Intuitively, we might conjecture that if one layer has activation values that are 100x that of another layer, this might necessitate compensatory adjustments in the learning rates.\n",
    "Deeper networks are complex and easily capable of overfitting. This means that regularization becomes more critical.\n",
    "Batch normalization is applied to individual layers (optionally, to all of them) and works as follows: In each training iteration, we first normalize the inputs (of batch normalization) by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation, where both are estimated based on the statistics of the current minibatch. Next, we apply a scaling coefficient and a scaling offset. It is precisely due to this normalization based on batch statistics that batch normalization derives its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we tried to apply BN with minibatches of size $1$, we would not be able to learn anything. That is because after subtracting the means, each hidden node would take value $0$! As you might guess, since we are devoting a whole section to BN, with large enough minibatches, the approach proves effective and stable. One takeaway here is that when applying BN, the choice of minibatch size may be even more significant than without BN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, BN transforms the activations at a given layer $\\mathbf{x}$ according to the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{BN}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{\\gamma} \\odot \\frac{\\mathbf{x} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\mu}}}{\\hat\\sigma} + \\mathbf{\\beta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\mu}}$ is the minibatch sample mean and $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}$ is the minibatch sample standard deviation. After applying BN, the resulting minibatch of activations has zero mean and unit variance. Because the choice of unit variance (vs some other magic number) is an arbitrary choice, we commonly include coordinate-wise scaling coefficients $\\mathbf{\\gamma}$ and offsets $\\mathbf{\\beta}$. Consequently, the activation magnitudes for intermediate layers cannot diverge during training because BN actively centers and rescales them back to a given mean and size (via $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ and $\\sigma$). One piece of practitioner's intuition/wisdom is that BN seems to allows for more aggressive learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, denoting a particular minibatch by $\\mathcal{B}$, we calculate $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\mu}}\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\hat\\sigma\\mathcal{B}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mathbf{\\mu}}\\mathcal{B} \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}} \\mathbf{x} \\text{ and } \\hat{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}\\mathcal{B}^2 \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{\\mu}_{\\mathcal{B}})^2 + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we add a small constant $\\epsilon > 0$ to the variance estimate to ensure that we never attempt division by zero, even in cases where the empirical variance estimate might vanish. The estimates $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\mu}}\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}\\mathcal{B}$ counteract the scaling issue by using noisy estimates of mean and variance. You might think that this noisiness should be a problem. As it turns out, this is actually beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be a recurring theme in deep learning. For reasons that are not yet well-characterized theoretically, various sources of noise in optimization often lead to faster training and less overfitting. While traditional machine learning theorists might buckle at this characterization, this variation appears to act as a form of regularization. In some preliminary research, :cite:Teye.Azizpour.Smith.2018 and :cite:Luo.Wang.Shao.ea.2018 relate the properties of BN to Bayesian Priors and penalties respectively. In particular, this sheds some light on the puzzle of why BN works best for moderate minibatches sizes in the $50$–$100$ range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixing a trained model, you might (rightly) think that we would prefer to use the entire dataset to estimate the mean and variance. Once training is complete, why would we want the same image to be classified differently, depending on the batch in which it happens to reside? During training, such exact calculation is infeasible because the activations for all data points change every time we update our model. However, once the model is trained, we can calculate the means and variances of each layer's activations based on the entire dataset. Indeed this is standard practice for models employing batch normalization and thus MXNet's BN layers function differently in training mode (normalizing by minibatch statistics) and in prediction mode (normalizing by dataset statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to take a look at how batch normalization works in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch normalization implementations for fully-connected layers and convolutional layers are slightly different. We discuss both cases below. Recall that one key differences between BN and other layers is that because BN operates on a full minibatch at a time, we cannot just ignore the batch dimension as we did before when introducing other layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully-Connected Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying BN to fully-connected layers, we usually insert BN after the affine transformation and before the nonlinear activation function. Denoting the input to the layer by $\\mathbf{x}$, the linear transform (with weights $\\theta$) by $f_{\\theta}(\\cdot)$, the activation function by $\\phi(\\cdot)$, and the BN operation with parameters $\\mathbf{\\beta}$ and $\\mathbf{\\gamma}$ by $\\mathrm{BN}_{\\mathbf{\\beta}, \\mathbf{\\gamma}}$, we can express the computation of a BN-enabled, fully-connected layer $\\mathbf{h}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h} = \\phi(\\mathrm{BN}{\\mathbf{\\beta}, \\mathbf{\\gamma}}(f{\\mathbf{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x}) ) ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that mean and variance are computed on the same minibatch $\\mathcal{B}$ on which the transformation is applied. Also recall that the scaling coefficient $\\mathbf{\\gamma}$ and the offset $\\mathbf{\\beta}$ are parameters that need to be learned jointly with the more familiar parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, with convolutional layers, we typically apply BN after the convolution and before the nonlinear activation function. When the convolution has multiple output channels, we need to carry out batch normalization for each of the outputs of these channels, and each channel has its own scale and shift parameters, both of which are scalars. Assume that our minibatches contain $m$ each and that for each channel, the output of the convolution has height $p$ and width $q$. For convolutional layers, we carry out each batch normalization over the $m \\cdot p \\cdot q$ elements per output channel simultaneously. Thus we collect the values over all spatial locations when computing the mean and variance and consequently (within a given channel) apply the same $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\mu}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}$ to normalize the values at each spatial location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization During Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, BN typically behaves differently in training mode and prediction mode. First, the noise in $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ and $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ arising from estimating each on minibatches are no longer desirable once we have trained the model. Second, we might not have the luxury of computing per-batch normalization statistics, e.g., we might need to apply our model to make one prediction at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, after training, we use the entire dataset to compute stable estimates of the activation statistics and then fix them at prediction time. Consequently, BN behaves differently during training and at test time. Recall that dropout also exhibits this characteristic.\n",
