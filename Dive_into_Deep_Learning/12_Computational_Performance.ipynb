    "# 12. Computational Performance\n",
    "In deep learning, datasets are usually large and model computation is complex. Therefore, we are always very concerned about computing performance. This chapter will focus on the important factors that affect computing performance: imperative programming, symbolic programming, asynchronous programing, automatic parallel computation, and multi-GPU computation. By studying this chapter, you should be able to further improve the computing performance of the models that have been implemented in the previous chapters, for example, by reducing the model training time without affecting the accuracy of the model.\n",

    "Python is an interpreted language. When evaluating `fancy_func` it performs the operations making up the function's body in `sequence`. That is, it will evaluate `e = add(a, b)` and it will store the results as variable `e`, thereby changing the program's state. The next two statements `f = add(c, d)` and `g = add(e, f)` will be excecuted similarly, performing additions and storing the results as variables. `Fig. 12.1.1` illustrates the flow of data.\n",

    "Although imperative programming is convenient, it may be inefficient. On one hand, even if the `add` function is repeatedly called throughout `fancy_func`, Python will execute the three function calls individually. If these are executed, say, on a GPU (or even on multiple GPUs), the overhead arising from the Python interpreter can become overwhelming. Moreover, it will need to save the variable values of `e` and `f` until all the statements in `fancy_func` have been executed. This is because we do not know whether the variables `e` and `f` will be used by other parts of the program after the statements `e = add(a, b)` and `f = add(c, d)` have been executed.\n",

It usually involves the following steps:\n",

    "This allows for a significant amount of optimization. First off, we can skip the Python interpreter in many cases, thus removing a performance bottleneck that can become significant on multiple fast GPUs paired with a single Python thread on a CPU. Secondly, a compiler might optimize and rewrite the above code into `print((1 + 2) + (3 + 4))` or even `print(10)`. This is possible since a compiler gets to see the full code before turning it into machine instructions. For instance, it can release memory (or never allocate it) whenever a variable is no longer needed. Or it can transform the code entirely into an equivalent piece. To get a better idea consider the following simulation of imperative programming (it is Python after all) below."

It is also easier to debug imperative programming code. This is because it is easier to obtain and print all relevant intermediate variable values, or use Python’s built-in debugging tools.\n",
    "+ Symbolic programming is more efficient and easier to port. It makes it easier to optimize the code during compilation, while also having the ability to port the program into a format independent of Python. This allows the program to be run in a non-Python environment, thus avoiding any potential performance issues related to the Python interpreter.\n",

    "### 12.1.2 Hybrid Programming\n",
    "Historically most deep learning frameworks choose between an imperative or a symbolic approach. For example, `Theano`, `TensorFlow` (inspired by the latter), `Keras` and `CNTK` formulate models symbolically. Conversely, `Chainer` and `PyTorch` take an imperative approach. An imperative mode was added to `TensorFlow 2.0` (via `Eager`) and `Keras` in later revisions. When designing `Gluon`, developers considered whether it would be possible to combine the benefits of both programming models. This led to a hybrid model that lets users develop and debug using pure imperative programming, while having the ability to convert most programs into symbolic programs to be run when product-level computing performance and deployment are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this means that we build models using either the `HybridBlock` or the `HybridSequential` and `HybridConcurrent` classes. By default, they are executed in the same way `Block` or `Sequential` and `Concurrent` classes are executed in imperative programming. `HybridSequential` is a subclass of `HybridBlock` (just like `Sequential` subclasses `Block`). When the hybridize function is called, `Gluon` compiles the model into the form used in symbolic programming. This allows one to optimize the compute-intensive components without sacrifices in the way a model is implemented. We will illustrate the benefits below, focusing on sequential models and blocks only (the concurrent composition works analogously).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.1.3 HybridSequential\n",
    "The easiest way to get a feel for how hybridization works is to consider deep networks with multiple layers. Conventionally the Python interpreter will need to execute the code for all layers to generate an instruction that can then be forwarded to a CPU or a GPU. For a single (fast) compute device this does not cause any major issues. On the other hand, if we use an advanced 8-GPU server such as an `AWS P3dn.24xlarge` instance Python will struggle to keep all GPUs busy. The single-threaded Python interpreter becomes the bottleneck here. Let us see how we can address this for significant parts of the code by replacing `Sequential` by `HybridSequential`. We begin by defining a simple `MLP`."

    "## 12.2 Asynchronous Computation\n",
    "Today's computers are highly parallel systems, consisting of multiple CPU cores (often multiple threads per core), multiple processing elements per GPU and often multiple GPUs per device. In short, we can process many different things at the same time, often on different devices. Unfortunately Python is not a great way of writing parallel and asynchronous code, at least not with some extra help. After all, Python is single-threaded and this is unlikely to change in the future. Deep learning frameworks such as `MXNet` and `TensorFlow` utilize an asynchronous programming model to improve performance (`PyTorch` uses Python's own scheduler leading to a different performance trade-off). Hence, understanding how asynchronous programming works helps us to develop more efficient programs, by proactively reducing computational requirements and mutual dependencies. This allows us to reduce memory overhead and increase processor utilization. We begin by importing the necessary libraries.\n",

Using a computational graph, the system is aware of all the dependencies, and can selectively execute multiple non-interdependent tasks in parallel to improve speed. For instance, `Fig. 12.2.2` in `Section 12.2` initializes two variables independently. Consequently the system can choose to execute them in parallel.\n",

For example, the `dot` operator will use all cores (and threads) on all CPUs, even if there are multiple CPU processors on a single machine. The same applies to a single GPU. Hence parallelization is not quite so useful single-device computers. With multiple devices things matter more. While parallelization is typically most relevant between multiple GPUs, adding the local CPU will increase performance slightly. See e.g., (`Hadjis et al., 2016`) for a paper that focuses on training computer vision models combining a GPU and a CPU. With the convenience of an automatically parallelizing framework we can accomplish the same goal in a few lines of Python code.

This situatio occurs, e.g., when we compute the (backprop) gradient on a minibatch. The gradients of some of the parameters will be available earlier than that of others. Hence it works to our advantage to start using `PCI-Express` bus bandwidth while the GPU is still running. Removing `waitall` between both parts allows us to simulate this scenario."

    "## 12.4 Hardware\n",
    "Building systems with great performance requires a good understanding of the algorithms and models to capture the statistical aspects of the problem. At the same time it is also indispensable to have at least a modicum of knowledge of the underlying hardware. The current section is no substitute for a proper course on hardware and systems design. Instead, it might serve as a starting point for understanding why some algorithms are more efficient than others and how to achieve good throughput. Good design can easily make a difference of an order of magnitude and, in turn, this can make the difference between being able to train a network (e.g., in a week) or not at all (in 3 months, thus missing the deadline). We will start by looking at computers. Then we will zoom in to look more carefully at CPUs and GPUs. Lastly we zoom out to review how multiple computers are connected in a server center or in the cloud. This is not a GPU purchase guide. For this review `Section 19.5`. An introduction to cloud computing with AWS can be found in `Section 19.3`.\n",

The discussion below explains some of the rationale for these numbers and how they can guide us in designing algorithms. The discussion below is very high level and cursory. It is clearly no substitute for a proper course but rather just meant to provide enough information for a statistical modeler to make suitable design decisions.

    "### 12.4.1 Computers\n",
    "Most deep learning researchers have access to a computer with a fair amount of memory, compute, some form of an accelerator such as a GPU, or multiples thereof. It consists of several key components:\n",
    "+ A processor, also referred to as CPU which is able to execute the programs we give it (in addition to running an operating system and many other things), typically consisting of 8 or more cores.\n",
    "+ Memory (RAM) to store and retrieve the results from computation, such as weight vectors, activations, often training data.\n",
    "+ An Ethernet network connection (sometimes multiple) with speeds ranging from 1Gbit/s to 100Gbit/s (on high end servers more advanced interconnects can be found).\n",
    "+ A high speed expansion bus (PCIe) to connect the system to one or more GPUs. Severs have up to 8 accelerators, often connected in an advanced topology, desktop systems have 1-2, depending on the budget of the user and the size of the power supply.\n",
    "+ Durable storage, such as a magnetic harddrive (HDD), solid state (SSD), in many cases connected using the PCIe bus, provides efficient transfer of training data to the system and storage of intermediate checkpoints as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/12_07.png\" style=\"width:400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As `Fig. 12.4.2` indicates, most components (network, GPU, storage) are connected to the CPU across the PCI Express bus. It consists of multiple lanes that are directly attached to the CPU. For instance AMD's Threadripper 3 has 64 PCIe 4.0 lanes, each of which is capable `16 Gbit/s` data transfer in both directions. The memory is directly attached to the CPU with a total bandwidth of up to `100 GB/s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run code on a computer we need to shuffle data to the processors (CPU or GPU), perform computation and then move the results off the processor back to RAM and durable storage. Hence, in order to get good performance we need to make sure that this works seamlessly without any one of the systems becoming a major bottleneck. For instance, if we cannot load images quickly enough the processor will not have any work to do. Likewise, if we cannot move matrices quickly enough to the CPU (or GPU), its processing elements will starve. Finally, if we want to synchronize multiple computers across the network, the latter should not slow down computation. One option is to interleave communication and computation. Let us have a look at the various components in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.4.2 Memory\n",
    "At its most basic memory is used to store data that needs to be readily accessible. At present CPU RAM is typically of the DDR4 variety, offering `20-25GB/s` bandwidth per module. Each module has a 64 bit wide bus. Typically pairs of memory modules are used to allow for multiple channels. CPUs have between 2 and 4 memory channels, i.e., they have between `40GB/s` and `100GB/s` peak memory bandwidth. Often there are two banks per channel. For instance `AMD`'s `Zen 3 Threadripper` has 8 slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these numbers are impressive, indeed, they only tell part of the story. When we want to read a portion from memory we first need to tell the memory module where the information can be found. That is, we first need to send the address to RAM. Once this accomplished we can choose to read just a single 64bit record or a long sequence of records. The latter is called burst read. In a nutshell, sending an address to memory and setting up the transfer takes approximately `100ns` (details depend on the specific timing coefficients of the memory chips used), every subsequent transfer takes only `0.2ns`. In short, the first read is 500 times as expensive as subsequent ones! We could perform up to $10,000,000$ random reads per second. This suggests that we avoid random memory access as far as possible and use burst reads (and writes) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matters are a bit more complex when we take into account that we have multiple banks. Each bank can read memory largely independently. This means two things: the effective number of random reads is up to `4x` higher, provided that they are spread evenly across memory. It also means that it is still a bad idea to perform random reads since burst reads are `4x` faster, too. Secondly, due to memory alignment to 64 bit boundaries it is a good idea to align any datastructures with the same boundaries. Compilers do this pretty much automatically when the appropriate flags are set. Curious readers are encouraged to review a lecture on DRAMs such as the one by `Zeshan Chishti`.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU memory is subject to even higher bandwidth requirements since they have many more processing elements than CPUs. By and large there are two options to address them. One is to make the memory bus significantly wider. For instance `NVIDIA`'s `RTX 2080 Ti` has a 352 bit wide bus. This allows for much more information to be transferred at the same time. Secondly, GPUs use specific high-performance memory. Consumer grade devices, such as `NVIDIA`'s `RTX` and `Titan` series typically use GDDR6 chips with over `500 GB/s` aggregate bandwidth. An alternative is to use HBM (high bandwidth memory) modules. They use a very different interface and connect directly with GPUs on a dedicated silicon wafer. This makes them very expensive and their use is typically limited to high end server chips, such as the `NVIDIA Volta V100` series of accelerators. Quite unsurprisingly GPU memory is much smaller than CPU memory due to its higher cost. For our purposes, by and large their performance characteristics are similar, just a lot faster. We can safely ignore the details for the purpose of this book. They only matter when tuning GPU kernels for high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.4.3 Storage\n",
    "We saw that some of the key characteristics of RAM were bandwidth and latency. The same is true for storage devices, just that the differences can be even more extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard Disks** have been in use for over half a century. In a nutshell they contain a number of spinning platters with heads that can be positioned to read / write at any given track. High end end disks hold up to 16TB on 9 platters. One of the key benefits of HDDs is that they are relatively inexpensive. One of their many downsides are their typically catastrophic failure modes and their relatively high read latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the latter, consider the fact that HDDs spin at around `7,200` RPM. If they were much faster they would shatter due to the centrifugal force exerted on the platters. This has a major downside when it comes to accessing a specific sector on the disk: we need to wait until the platter has rotated in position (we can move the heads but not accelerate the actual disks). Hence it can take over `8ms` until the requested data is available. A common way this is expressed is to say that HDDs can operate at approximately 100 IOPs. This number has essentially remained unchanged for the past two decades. Worse still, it is equally difficult to increase bandwidth (it is in the order of `100-200 MB/s`). After all, each head reads a track of bits, hence the bit rate only scales with the square root of the information density. As a result HDDs are quickly becoming relegated to archival storage and low-grade storage for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solid State Drives** use Flash memory to store information persistently. This allows for much faster access to stored records. Modern SSDs can operate at `100,000` to `500,000` IOPs, i.e., up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than HDDs. Furthermore, their bandwidth can reach `1-3GB/s`, i.e., one order of magnitude faster than HDDs. These improvements sound almost too good to be true. Indeed, they come with a number of caveats, due to the way SSDs are designed.\n",
    "+ SSDs store information in blocks (`256 KB` or larger). They can only be written as a whole, which takes significant time. Consequently bit-wise random writes on SSD have very poor performance. Likewise, writing data in general takes significant time since the block has to be read, erased and then rewritten with new information. By now SSD controllers and firmware have developed algorithms to mitigate this. Nonetheless writes can be much slower, in particular for QLC (quad level cell) SSDs. The key for improved performance is to maintain a queue of operations, to prefer reads and to write in large blocks if possible.\n",
    "+ The memory cells in SSDs wear out relatively quickly (often already after a few thousand writes). Wear-level protection algorithms are able to spread the degradation over many cells. That said, it is not recommended to use SSDs for swap files or for large aggregations of log-files.\n",
    "+ Lastly, the massive increase in bandwidth has forced computer designers to attach SSDs directly to the PCIe bus. The drives capable of handling this, referred to as NVMe (Non Volatile Memory enhanced), can use up to 4 PCIe lanes. This amounts to up to `8GB/s` on `PCIe 4.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Storage provides a configurable range of performance. That is, the assignment of storage to virtual machines is dynamic, both in terms of quantity and in terms speed, as chosen by the user. We recommend that the user increase the provisioned number of IOPs whenever latency is too high, e.g., during training with many small records."

    "### 12.4.4 CPUs\n",
    "Central Processing Units (CPUs) are the centerpiece of any computer (as before we give a very high level description focusing primarily on what matters for efficient deep learning models). They consist of a number of key components: processor cores which are able to execute machine code, a bus connecting them (the specific topology differs significantly between processor models, generations and vendors), and caches to allow for higher bandwidth and lower latency memory access than what is possible by reads from main memory. Lastly, almost all modern CPUs contain vector processing units to aid with high performance linear algebra and convolutions, as they are common in media processing and machine learning.\n",

    "Each of the processor cores consists of a rather sophisticated set of components. While details differ between generations and vendors, the basic functionality is pretty much standard. The front end loads instructions and tries to predict which path will be taken (e.g., for control flow). Instructions are then decoded from assembly code to microinstructions. Assembly code is often not the lowest level code that a processor executes. Instead, complex instructions may be decoded into a set of more lower level operations. These are then processed by the actual execution core. Often the latter is capable of performing many operations simultaneously. For instance, the ARM Cortex A77 core of :numref:fig_cortexa77 is able to perform up to 8 operations simultaneously."
