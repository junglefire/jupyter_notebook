    "# 13. Computer Vision\n",
    "Many applications in the area of computer vision are closely related to our daily lives, now and in the future, whether medical diagnostics, driverless vehicles, camera monitoring, or smart filters. In recent years, deep learning technology has greatly enhanced computer vision systems' performance. It can be said that the most advanced computer vision applications are nearly inseparable from deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have introduced deep learning models commonly used in the area of computer vision in the chapter \"Convolutional Neural Networks\" and have practiced simple image classification tasks. In this chapter, we will introduce image augmentation and fine tuning methods and apply them to image classification. Then, we will explore various methods of object detection. After that, we will learn how to use fully convolutional networks to perform semantic segmentation on images. Then, we explain how to use style transfer technology to generate images that look like the cover of this book. Finally, we will perform practice exercises on two important computer vision datasets to review the content of this chapter and the previous chapters.\n",

    "## 13.9 Semantic Segmentation and the Dataset\n",
    "In our discussion of object detection issues in the previous sections, we only used rectangular bounding boxes to label and predict objects in images. In this section, we will look at semantic segmentation, which attempts to segment images into regions with different semantic categories. These semantic regions label and predict objects at the pixel level. `Fig. 13.9.1` shows a semantically-segmented image, with areas labeled `dog`, `cat`, and `background`. As you can see, compared to object detection, semantic segmentation labels areas with pixel-level borders, for significantly greater precision.\n",

    "### 13.9.1 Image Segmentation and Instance Segmentation\n",
    "In the computer vision field, there are two important methods related to semantic segmentation: \n",
    "+ **image segmentation**\n",
    "+ **instance segmentation** \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will distinguish these concepts from semantic segmentation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Image segmentation divides an image into several constituent regions. This method generally uses the correlations between pixels in an image. During training, labels are not needed for image pixels. However, during prediction, this method cannot ensure that the segmented regions have the semantics we want. If we input the image in 9.10, image segmentation might divide the dog into two regions, one covering the dog's mouth and eyes where black is the prominent color and the other covering the rest of the dog where yellow is the prominent color.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Instance segmentation is also called simultaneous detection and segmentation. This method attempts to identify the pixel-level regions of each object instance in an image. In contrast to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation not only distinguishes semantics, but also different object instances. If an image contains two dogs, instance segmentation will distinguish which pixels belong to which dog.\n",

    "### 13.9.2 The Pascal VOC2012 Semantic Segmentation Dataset\n",
    "In the semantic segmentation field, one important dataset is `Pascal VOC2012`. To better understand this dataset, we must first import the package or module needed for the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original site might be unstable, so we download the data from a mirror site. The archive is about 2 GB, so it will take some time to download. After you decompress the archive, the dataset is located in the `./data/VOCdevkit/VOC2012` path."
