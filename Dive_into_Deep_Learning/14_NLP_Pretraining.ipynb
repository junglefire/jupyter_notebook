    "# 14. Natural Language Processing: Pretraining\n",
    "Humans need to communicate. Out of this basic need of the human condition, a vast amount of written text has been generated on an everyday basis. Given rich text in social media, chat apps, emails, product reviews, news articles, research papers, and books, it becomes vital to enable computers to understand them to offer assistance or make decisions based on human languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing studies interactions between computers and humans using natural languages. In practice, it is very common to use natural language processing techniques to process and analyze text (human natural language) data, such as language models in `Section 8.3` and machine translation models in `Section 9.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand text, we can begin with its representation, such as treating each word or subword as an individual text token. As we will see in this chapter, the representation of each token can be pretrained on a large corpus, using `word2vec`, `GloVe`, or `subword embedding` models. After pretraining, representation of each token can be a vector, however, it remains the same no matter what the context is. For instance, the vector representation of \"bank\" is the same in both \"go to the bank to deposit some money\" and \"go to the bank to sit down\". Thus, many more recent pretraining models adapt representation of the same token to different contexts. Among them is `BERT`, a much deeper model based on the `Transformer` encoder. In this chapter, we will focus on how to pretrain such representations for text, as highlighted in `Fig. 14.1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/14_01.png\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in `Fig. 14.1`, the pretrained text representations can be fed to a variety of deep learning architectures for different downstream natural language processing applications. We will cover them in `Chapter 15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.1 Word Embedding (word2vec)\n",
    "A natural language is a complex system that we use to express meanings. In this system, words are the basic unit of linguistic meaning. As its name implies, a word vector is a vector used to represent a word. It can also be thought of as the feature vector of a word. The technique of mapping words to vectors of real numbers is also known as `word embedding`. Over the last few years, word embedding has gradually become basic knowledge in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.1.1 Why Not Use One-hot Vectors?\n",
    "We used one-hot vectors to represent words (characters are words) in `Section 8.5`. Recall that when we assume the number of different words in a dictionary (the dictionary size) is $N$, each word can correspond one-to-one with consecutive integers from 0 to $N-1$. These integers that correspond to words are called the indices of the words. We assume that the index of a word is $i$. In order to get the one-hot vector representation of the word, we create a vector of all `0`s with a length of $N$ and set element $i$ to 1. In this way, each word is represented as a vector of length $N$ that can be used directly by the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although one-hot word vectors are easy to construct, they are usually not a good choice. One of the major reasons is that the one-hot word vectors cannot accurately express the similarity between different words, such as the cosine similarity that we commonly use. For the vectors $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, their cosine similarities are the cosines of the angles between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\frac{\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{y}}{\\lVert\\mathbf{x}\\rVert \\lVert\\mathbf{y}\\rVert} \\in [-1, 1].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the cosine similarity between the one-hot vectors of any two different words is 0, it is difficult to use the one-hot vector to accurately represent the similarity between multiple different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Word2vec` is a tool that we came up with to solve the problem above. It represents each word with a fixed-length vector and uses these vectors to better indicate the similarity and analogy relationships between different words. The Word2vec tool contains two models: skip-gram (`Mikolov et al., 2013b`) and continuous bag of words (CBOW) (`Mikolov et al., 2013a`). Next, we will take a look at the two models and their training methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.1.2 The Skip-Gram Model\n",
    "The skip-gram model assumes that a word can be used to generate the words that surround it in a text sequence. For example, we assume that the text sequence is `the`, `man`, `loves`, `his`, and `son`. We use `loves` as the central target word and set the context window size to 2. As shown in `Fig. 14.1.1`, given the central target word `loves`, the skip-gram model is concerned with the conditional probability for generating the context words, `the`, `man`, `his` and `son`, that are within a distance of no more than 2 words, which is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{\"the\"},\\textrm{\"man\"},\\textrm{\"his\"},\\textrm{\"son\"}\\mid\\textrm{\"loves\"}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that, given the central target word, the context words are generated independently of each other. In this case, the formula above can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{\"the\"}\\mid\\textrm{\"loves\"})\\cdot P(\\textrm{\"man\"}\\mid\\textrm{\"loves\"})\\cdot P(\\textrm{\"his\"}\\mid\\textrm{\"loves\"})\\cdot P(\\textrm{\"son\"}\\mid\\textrm{\"loves\"}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/14_02.png\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the skip-gram model, each word is represented as two $d$-dimension vectors, which are used to compute the conditional probability. We assume that the word is indexed as $i$ in the dictionary, its vector is represented as $\\mathbf{v}_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ when it is the central target word, and $\\mathbf{u}_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ when it is a context word. Let the central target word $w_c$ and context word $w_o$ be indexed as $c$ and $o$ respectively in the dictionary. The conditional probability of generating the context word for the given central target word can be obtained by performing a softmax operation on the vector inner product:\n",

Assume that context words are independently generated given center words. When context window size is $m$, the likelihood function of the skip-gram model is the joint probability of generating all the context words given any center word\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Skip-Gram Model Training\n",
    "The skip-gram model parameters are the central target word vector and context word vector for each individual word.

    "### 14.1.3 The Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model\n",
    "The continuous bag of words (CBOW) model is similar to the skip-gram model. The biggest difference is that the CBOW model assumes that the central target word is generated based on the context words before and after it in the text sequence.
