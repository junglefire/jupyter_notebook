    "#  10. Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "As a bit of a historical digression, attention research is an enormous field with a long history in cognitive neuroscience. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of the essence of attention, which enable the human to prioritize the perception in order to deal effectively with others. As a result, we do not process all the information that is available in the sensory input. At any time, we are aware of only a small fraction of the information in the environment. In cognitive neuroscience, there are several types of attention such as selective attention, covert attention, and spatial attention. The theory ignites the spark in recent deep learning is the `feature integration theory` of the selective attention, which was developed by Anne Treisman and Garry Gelade through the paper (`Treisman & Gelade, 1980`) in 1980. This paper declares that when perceiving a stimulus, features are registered early, automatically, and in parallel, while objects are identified separately and at a later stage in processing. The theory has been one of the most influential psychological models of human visual attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will not indulge in too much theory of attention in neuroscience, but rather focus on applying the attention idea in deep learning, where attention can be seen as a generalized pooling method with bias alignment over inputs. In this chapter, we will provide you with some intuition about how to transform the attention idea to the concrete mathematics models, and make them work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.1 Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "In `Section 9.7`, we encode the source sequence input information in the recurrent unit state and then pass it to the `decoder` to generate the target sequence. A token in the target sequence may closely relate to one or more tokens in the source sequence, instead of the whole source sequence. For example, when translating \"Hello world.\" to \"Bonjour le monde.\", \"Bonjour\" maps to \"Hello\" and \"monde\" maps to \"world\". In the `seq2seq` model, the `decoder` may implicitly select the corresponding information from the state passed by the `encoder`. The attention mechanism, however, makes this selection explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Attention` is a generalized pooling method with bias alignment over inputs. The core component in the attention mechanism is the `attention layer`, or called `attention` for simplicity. An input of the `attention layer` is called a `query`. For a `query`, `attention` returns an output based on the memory---a set of key-value pairs encoded in the `attention layer`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, assume that the memory contains $n$ key-value pairs, $(\\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{v}_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{k}_n, \\mathbf{v}_n)$, with $\\mathbf{k}_i \\in \\mathbb R^{d_k}$, $\\mathbf{v}_i \\in \\mathbb R^{d_v}$. Given a query $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb R^{d_q}$, the attention layer returns an output $\\mathbf{o} \\in \\mathbb R^{d_v}$ with the same shape as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/10_01.png\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The full process of attention mechanism is expressed in `Fig. 10.1.2`. To compute the output of attention, we first use a score function $\\alpha$ that measures the similarity between the query and the key. So for each key $\\mathbf{k}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_n$, we compute the scores $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_i = \\alpha(\\mathbf q, \\mathbf k_i).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we use softmax to obtain the attention weights, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{b} = \\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{a})\\quad \\text{, where }\\quad {b}_i = \\frac{\\exp(a_i)}{\\displaystyle\\sum_j \\exp(a_j)}, \\mathbf{b} = [b_1, \\ldots, b_n]^T .$$\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"images/10_02.png\" style=\"width:400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Different choices of the score function lead to different `attention layers`. Below, we introduce two commonly used `attention layers`. Before diving into the implementation, we first express two operators to get you up and running: a masked version of the softmax operator `masked_softmax` and a specialized dot operator `batch_dot`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The masked softmax takes a 3-dimensional input and enables us to filter out some elements by specifying a valid length for the last dimension. (Refer to `Section 9.5` for the definition of a valid length.) As a result, any value outside the valid length will be masked as $0$. Let us implement the `masked_softmax` function."

    "Similar to `Section 9.7.4`, we try a toy model by applying the same training hyperparameters and the same training loss. As we can see from the result, since the sequences in the training dataset are relatively short, the additional attention layer does not lead to a significant improvement. Due to the computational overhead of both the `encoder`'s and the `decoder`'s attention layers, this model is much slower than the `seq2seq` model without attention."

    "## 10.3 Transformer\n",
    "In previous chapters, we have covered major neural network architectures such as `convolution neural networks` (CNNs) and `recurrent neural networks` (RNNs). Let us recap their pros and cons:\n",
    "+ **CNN** are easy to parallelize at a layer but cannot capture the variable-length sequential dependency very well\n",
    "+ **RNN** are able to capture the long-range, variable-length sequential information, but suffer from inability to parallelize within a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine the advantages from both CNNs and RNNs, (`Vaswani et al., 2017`) designed a novel architecture using the attention mechanism. This architecture, which is called as `Transformer`, achieves parallelization by capturing recurrence sequence with attention and at the same time encodes each item's position in the sequence. As a result, `Transformer` leads to a compatible model with significantly shorter training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the `seq2seq` model in `Section 9.7`, `Transformer` is also based on the `encoder-decoder` architecture. However, `Transformer` differs to the former by replacing the recurrent layers in `seq2seq` with `multi-head attention layers`, incorporating the position-wise information through position encoding, and applying layer normalization. We compare `Transformer` and `seq2seq` side-by-side in `Fig. 10.3.1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these two models are similar to each other: the source sequence embeddings are fed into $n$ repeated blocks. The outputs of the last block are then used as attention memory for the `decoder`. The target sequence embeddings are similarly fed into $n$ repeated blocks in the `decoder`, and the final outputs are obtained by applying a dense layer with vocabulary size to the last block's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/10_05.png\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, `Transformer` differs from the `seq2seq` with attention model in the following:\n",
    "+ **Transformer block**: a recurrent layer in `seq2seq` is replaced by a `Transformer block`. This block contains a multi-head attention layer and a position-wise feed-forward network with two layers for the `encoder`. For the `decoder`, another multi-head attention layer is used to take the `encoder` state\n",
    "+ **Add and norm**: the inputs and outputs of both the multi-head attention layer or the position-wise feed-forward network, are processed by two `add and norm` layer that contains a residual structure and a layer normalization layer\n",
    "+ **Position encoding**: since the self-attention layer does not distinguish the item order in a sequence, a positional encoding layer is used to add sequential information into each sequence item\n",

    "In the rest of this section, we will equip you with each new component introduced by `Transformer`, and get you up and running to construct a machine translation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.3.1 Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "Before the discussion of the multi-head attention layer, let us quick express the `self-attention architecture`. The self-attention model is a normal attention model, with its query, its key, and its value being copied exactly the same from each item of the sequential inputs. As we illustrate in `Fig. 10.3.2`, self-attention outputs a same-length sequential output for each input item. Compared with a recurrent layer, output items of a self-attention layer can be computed in parallel and, therefore, it is easy to obtain a highly-efficient implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/10_06.png\" style=\"width:350px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `multi-head attention layer` consists of $h$ parallel self-attention layers, each one is called a `head`. For each head, before feeding into the attention layer, we project the queries, keys, and values with three dense layers with hidden sizes $p_q$, $p_k$, and $p_v$, respectively. The outputs of these $h$ attention heads are concatenated and then processed by a final dense layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/10_07.png\" style=\"width:450px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the dimension for a query, a key, and a value are $d_q$, $d_k$, and $d_v$, respectively. Then, for each head $i=1,\\ldots, h$, we can train learnable parameters $\\mathbf W_q^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_q\\times d_q}$, $\\mathbf W_k^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_k\\times d_k}$, and $\\mathbf W_v^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_v\\times d_v}$. Therefore, the output for each head is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf o^{(i)} = \\textrm{attention}(\\mathbf W_q^{(i)}\\mathbf q, \\mathbf W_k^{(i)}\\mathbf k,\\mathbf W_v^{(i)}\\mathbf v),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\textrm{attention}$ can be any attention layer, such as the `DotProductAttention` and `MLPAttention` as we introduced in `Section 10.1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the output with length $p_v$ from each of the $h$ attention heads are concatenated to be an output of length $h p_v$, which is then passed the final dense layer with $d_o$ hidden units. The weights of this dense layer can be denoted by $\\mathbf W_o\\in\\mathbb R^{d_o\\times h p_v}$. As a result, the multi-head attention output will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf o = \\mathbf W_o \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf o^{(1)} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf o^{(h)}\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can implement the multi-head attention. Assume that the multi-head attention contain the number heads num_heads $=h$, the hidden size num_hiddens $=p_q=p_k=p_v$ are the same for the query, key, and value dense layers. In addition, since the multi-head attention keeps the same dimensionality between its input and its output, we have the output feature size $d_o =$ num_hiddens as well."

    "Besides the above two components in the `Transformer` block, the \"add and norm\" within the block also plays a key role to connect the inputs and outputs of other layers smoothly. To explain, we add a layer that contains a residual structure and a `layer normalization` after both the `multi-head attention layer` and the `position-wise FFN` network. `Layer normalization` is similar to `batch normalization` in `Section 7.5`. One difference is that the mean and variances for the `layer normalization` are calculated along the last dimension, e.g `X.mean(axis=-1)` instead of the first batch dimension, e.g., `X.mean(axis=0)`. `Layer normalization` prevents the range of values in the layers from changing too much, which allows faster training and better generalization ability.\n",

    "##### Summary\n",
    "+ The Transformer model is based on the encoder-decoder architecture.\n",
    "+ Multi-head attention layer contains $h$ parallel attention layers.\n",
    "+ Position-wise feed-forward network consists of two dense layers that apply to the last dimension.\n",
    "+ Layer normalization differs from batch normalization by normalizing along the last dimension (the feature dimension) instead of the first (batch size) dimension.\n",
    "+ Positional encoding is the only place that adds positional information to the Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exercises\n",
    "1. Try a larger size of epochs and compare the loss between seq2seq model and Transformer model.\n",
    "2. Can you think of any other benefit of positional encoding?\n",
    "3. Compare layer normalization and batch normalization, when shall we apply which?"
